# Campaigns Monitor

# What is it?

This is a basic listing tool that allows you to store campaign notes. It's built using Symfony 3, and over time, I hope to expand the functionality that the tool provides.

Events are broken down into 3 core entities. You have the theme (Season), assigned Staff member (Staff), and the event itself (Campaign). To begin with, ensure you have at least one Season stored in the system.

# Installation instructions

Grab the code and amend the config.php file and run the necessary schema update command. You should be good to go

# Pull Requests

This is not the finished project.  But I'll always welcome new ideas for it, so please submit pull requests, and if theres a way to do something better, please get in touch!
